# Bug report Command
This was requested by someone in DBM Network and I didn't think it would take so long to finish it.
This was a bigger project than i had originally intended as I kept improving it.

Currently this command will send the main message asking what the bug report is for: Bot, Discord, Server.
Then asks what the bug report is, searches for the channel to send to and if it doesn't exist, makes it, then sends an embed message to it.

Confirms to user their bug report was sent, deletes all sign of bug report in channel.

Usage: [p]bug

Note: Probably requires DBM Beta and Mods.
