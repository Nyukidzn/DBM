# Invertimg Command
This command allows you to invert your avatar, a mentioned users avatar, or a image URL.

With the help of General Wrex I was able to make sure to be able to send an error message on non-image urls.

This requires the node module "is-image-url" to be installed.

Usage: [p]invertimg <none | @user | URL.png>

Note: Probably requires DBM Beta and Mods.
