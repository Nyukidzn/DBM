# Advanced Logging System
Based off DogV2's log system.
Made by: TheMonDon

# Description
This is an advanced logging system that checks multiple things and sends it to your defined channel.

Note: Requires DBM Beta and [Mods](https://github.com/Discord-Bot-Maker-Mods/DBM-Mods/tree/beta).
**NOTE: Requires node module quick.db!**

# What is logged?
Currently the following things are logged:
* Channel Created
* Channel-Deleted
* Channel-Updated
* Member-Join
* Member-Leave
* Message-Deleted
* Role-Created
* Role-Updated
* Role-Deleted
* Voice-Channel-Created
* Voice-Channel-Deleted
* Emoji-Created
* Emoji-Deleted

# How do I enable it?
You have to set your log channel and toggle the modules you want enabled.  
1. [p]setlogchannel #logchannel  
2. [p]togglelog all  

You can also do [p]togglelog (individual types) to disable certain "modules" like [p]togglelog emoji-deleted.
