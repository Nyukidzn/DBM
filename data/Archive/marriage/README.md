# Marriage System
I am posting this to github in hopes someone else can help make it work.  
Currently I believe everything is functional except sometimes when you send a marriage proposal and the person reacts, it will say the reaction timed out.

This is a system with a few commands  
User Commands:  
- [p]marry (@user) : to send a marriage proposal to someone.  
- [p]marry cancel : to cancel a pending marriage proposal.  
- [p]Spouse (optional @user) : check if you or another user has a spouse, pending proposal, or single and sends message with spouse name if applicable.  
- [p]divorce : Get a divorce from your spouse. Will make both you and your spouse single again, no confirmation.  

Note: Probably requires DBM Beta and Mods.

The mreset command is there to reset a marriage manually, can be useful if something goes wrong.
