# Kill Command
This kill command is based off of BrainStorm#0007's version. 

Description: It will generate a response based off a random number and send a message about how _hopefully_ the command author killed them. Doesn't always work like that though ;)
Usage: [p]kill @user

I have added over 14 new responses since the original command authors version, and more to come as I think of them! If you have any suggestions feel free to PM me!

Note: Requires DBM Beta and Mods.
Note 2: You have to have my updated version for check if member mod if you want to use action 10-12, otherwise safely delete those.
