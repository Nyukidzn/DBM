# Minecraft Username Information (fixed)
Original Command Author: ChileanS#0001

This command will display your Minecraft Username information. 
- Name Changes 
- UUID 
- Skin 
- NameMC Profile.
Usage: [p]mcaccount (username)

I changed some major things with the help of General Wrex to make this command not completely break the bot upon a username not being found, but the fundamentals are the same as the original command.
One major change is I changed the API to one that works more reliably as well.

Note: Probably requires DBM Beta and Mods.
