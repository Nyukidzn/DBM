# yesno Meme Command
This is the same as the drake meme, but with Phoenix SC the youtuber instead. (https://www.youtube.com/user/phnixhamstasc/featured)
I took the template from the reddit and white-outed to work with discord profile pics.

Essentially it just puts the mentioned user as no and you as yes.

Usage: [p]yesno (@user)

Note: Probably requires DBM Beta and Mods.

# Note: Meme commands are provided as-is and no gaurentee to work with future versions!
